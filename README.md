<b>Figure 1</b>: Schematic illustration of the evolution from siloed and platform-controlled agentic AI ecosystems to BetaWeb. (a) Current stage dominated by a few major giants, where users and agents are tightly connected within the ``walled garden'' of each platform, with only weak inter-platform links, reflecting digital feudalism concerns. (b) Conceptual open Agentic Web, where users and agents are globally connected, but face challenges such as privacy protection, coordination complexity, and incentive alignment. (c) Vision of BetaWeb, where decentralized infrastructure supports trustworthy, controllable, efficient, and fair interactions among globally connected users and agents.

**Table 1**: Overview of the five-stage evolutionary roadmap.

| **Stage** | **Name** | **Explanation** |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Stage 1 (S1) | Isolated Silos | Designed LaMAS under human control with siloed governance |
| Stage 2 (S2) | Pilot Decentralization | Decentralized LaMAS still human-led with limited agentic workflows |
| Stage 3 (S3) | Assisted Execution | Agent-assisted LaMAS freeing human labor |
| Stage 4 (S4) | Hybrid Governance | Co-governed LaMAS relieving human cognitive burdens |
| Stage 5 (S5) | Full Autonomy | Autonomous LaMAS with humans setting only the overarching direction |

<b>Figure 2</b>: Five-stage evolution diagram of BetaWeb. Stage 1 (Isolated Silos) shows independent systems where humans drive all tasks, and agents are confined within their platforms with minimal outward interaction. Stage 2 (Pilot Decentralization) introduces cross-platform collaboration, but agentic workflows are completed under human supervision. Stage 3 (Assisted Execution) involves agents to undertake specialized duties, reducing the workload on humans. Stage 4 (Hybrid Governance) depicts large-scale distributed collaboration, where agents participate in governance while humans focus on high-value decisions. Stage 5 (Full Autonomy) represents a fully autonomous system where agents operate globally with end-to-end self-management without human intervention, requiring only the presentation of intents or goals.
